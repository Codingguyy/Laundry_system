## 🧠 Structure Notes

* **`page.tsx`** now acts as the **dashboard (main entry point)**
* API routes are modular and separated by responsibility
* UI is component-driven with reusable building blocks
* Business logic is isolated inside `utils/`
* Global state + in-memory DB handled inside `store/`

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Folder names like `orderssss` are preserved to match the repository
* No database is used — data is stored in memory
* Floating UI components (navigation + activity panel) enhance usability

---


## 🧾 Sample Prompts Used (AI Requirement)

* "Design REST APIs for a laundry order management system using Next.js"
* "Fix TypeScript error: element implicitly has an 'any' type when indexing object"
* "How to structure dynamic API routes in Next.js App Router"
* "Tailwind CSS not working in Next.js, how to fix?"
* "How to prevent duplicate state updates in Zustand"
* "How to validate workflow status transitions"

---

## 🤖 AI Usage Report

### 🔹 Tools Used

* ChatGPT (primary development assistant)

---

### 🔹 Where AI Helped

* API design and route structuring
* TypeScript type creation and debugging
* Fixing Tailwind configuration issues
* Designing UI layout and page structure
* Implementing Zustand state patterns

---

### ⚠️ Where AI Fell Short

* Incorrect Tailwind setup (version mismatch)
* Incorrect typing for pricing map indexing
* Initial lack of proper status validation logic
* Message duplication due to improper state updates
* Confusion around Next.js route params typing

---

### 🔧 Improvements Made

* Implemented strict status flow validation
* Fixed duplicate message issue with controlled triggers
* Corrected Next.js route handler typing for production builds
* Refactored types for better safety and clarity
* Simplified UI for better usability

---

## ⚖️ Tradeoffs

* Used in-memory storage instead of a database for speed
* No authentication (focus on core features)
* UI kept minimal rather than highly styled

---

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

* Pricing controlled via backend map (not user input)
* Status transitions reflect real-world workflow
* Zustand chosen for simplicity and performance
* Floating widgets added to simulate real operational dashboards

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add persistent database (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)
* Implement authentication & role-based access
* Add estimated delivery customization
* Improve mobile responsiveness
* Add order history & logs
